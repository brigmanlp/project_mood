# project_mood
Bootcamp Class Project: User can type into the input field a sentence or phrase that they would like to use to evaluate how their day was. The Text Analytics API will return a score from 0 to 1 to rate the the positivity of the sentiment. Firebase would then save this score in an array to track the users mood over a period of time.
